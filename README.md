# Fastlane configuration

This is an example configuration of how we configure our [Fastlane](http://fastlane.tools) setup.

## Setup

The only thing you need to do is install the fastlane gem. Install snapshot by running this command in your CLI:

```
$ gem install fastlane
```

Copy the fastlane folder from this repo to your project root, and start tweaking.

## Our configuration

Our Fastlane configuration currently supports the following lanes.

### CI lane

Run the CI lane.

    $ fastlane ci

Performs the following tasks:

- Build the application.
- Run the tests.
- Run the tests on your AWS Device Farm.
- Send notifications to Slack.

### TestFlight lane

Run the TestFlight lane.

    $ fastlane testflight

Performs the following tasks:

- Version bumping with tagging.
- Build the application.
- Run the tests.
- Upload the application to Apple TestFlight.
- Upload the dSYM to Splunk.
- Send notifications to Slack.

### HockeyApp lane

Run the HockeyApp lane.

    $ fastlane hockey

Performs the following tasks:

- Version bumping with tagging.
- Build the application.
- Run the tests.
- Upload the application to HockeyApp.
- Send notifications to Slack.

## Remarks

### 'pilot' team id

When specifying the team_id parameter in the 'pilot' section of your fastfile, you can't use the team id as mentioned in the Apple Developer portal.
The correct team id can be found as follows:

- Login to itunesconnect (https://itunesconnect.apple.com/)
- Get output (JSON) from (https://itunesconnect.apple.com/WebObjects/iTunesConnect.woa/ra/user/detail)
- You can now get your iTunes Connect ids from the associatedAccounts array with the different contentProvider objects - the entry named contentProviderId reflects the iTunes Connect id, lookup for the name value to pick the correct one
